                    This is a task to test your memory. <br>
                    Firstly, you are asked to read a short story and memorize as much detail as you can.
                    Then you are asked to answer the questions based on the story. <br>
                    Your goal would be to answer the questions as correctly as you can, and as quickly as you can (the time for reading the story will also be counted). After reading a story and answering its questions, you will see how you rank among our other participants. </br></br>
                    There would be 5 questions for each story, and two stories in total.<br>
                    After answering them, you'll be directed to a questionnaire for your emotion reflection. </p>
