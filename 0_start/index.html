                    This is a task to test your memory. <br><br>
                    Firstly, you are asked to read a short story and memorize as many details as you can.
                    Then you are asked to answer the questions based on the story. <br>
                    Your goal is to answer questions as correctly as you can, and as quickly as you can (the time for reading the story will also be counted). </br>
                    After reading a story and answering its questions, you will see how you rank among our other participants based on how quick and correct you were. </br></br>
                    There will be 5 questions for each story, and there are two stories in total. At the end of the task, you'll be directed to a questionnaire. Your prolific ID will be asked at the end of the questionnaire. The whole task would take you around 15 minutes. </p>
